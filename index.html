                Hello, my name is Thembelihle Justin Masiza, but my prefered name is Justin, 
                I am a husband and a father of three beautiful children, two girls and a boy. 
                I am currently a full time employee working as a sales consultant for a company called Duram Smart Paints,
                and in my spare time I love watching soccer, drawing, and reading manga. I am also an online student studying towards a degree in Computer programming and Wed design. 
                I am excited to learn web development, because I love the creation process, and bringing the emagination to life.
                I can't wait to see where I will be after one year, in relation to where I am now.
            </p>
